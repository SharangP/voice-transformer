GMM-Based Speech Transformation Systems under Data Reduction
http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/archive_papers/ssw6/ssw6_119.pdf
    --Used GMM's on source and target. Compared similarities and what not? <-- weird
    --have different learning algorithms
    --How:
        MFCC vectors computing (sampling frequency is 16 Khz, a 30 ms Hamming window is applied, the analyzing step is 10ms). The order of the MFCC vector is set to 13 (including energy) except for the toda transformation, where a vector is of dimension 26 (MFCC with their deltas)
        Dynamic time warping between the source and target sequences using an euclidian norm on the MFCC vectors.
        Parameter estimation of the GMM models (means, covariances and weights). GMM models with 8, 32 and 64 components have been calculated. covariance matrices are full or diagonal.

Learning musical instruments from mixtures of audio with weak labels

    --Skimmed it...
    --Main take-away: FEATURES - Table 1:
        MFCCs
        Brightness - Ratio of energy above 1500Hz to energy below
        Spectral Stats - First four statistical moments of spectrum
        Flatness - Ratio of geometric to arithmetic mean of spectrum
        Pitch - Calculated using ﬁrst peak of autocorrelation function
        Amplitude - RMS
        Flux - Difference of spectrum between subsequent frames
        Inharmonicity - The strength of the pitch: amount of energy far from f0·n

    "All existing voice transformation systems simply normalise the mean and standard deviation of the fundamental frequency to be that of the target speakers."
